### Sorting algorithm in Python

Before going to see what sorting algorithm in used in  build-in function in Python, we review the common sorting algorithms: 

* Bubble Sort: 

It iterates over the list and in each iterate compares the two element and swaps the larger element to the right until the largest element is at the end of the list. Bublle is sort is not recursive and stable.

* Complexity: $$(o^2)$$
